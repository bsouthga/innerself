        I wrote innerself because I needed to make sense of the UI for a game I wrote for the js13kGames jam. The whole game had to fit into 13KB. I needed something extremely small which would not make me lose sanity. innerself clocks in at under 50 lines of code. That's around 600 bytes minified, ~350 gzipped.
